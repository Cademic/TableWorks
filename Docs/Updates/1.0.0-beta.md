# 1.0.0-beta — Patch Notes

Patch notes for the 1.0.0-beta release. This document summarizes the changes made to the website and backend in this release.

---

## Pinned Projects (like Pinned Boards)

### Backend
- **UserPinnedProjects** table: junction table for per-user project pinning (`UserId`, `ProjectId`, `PinnedAt`).
- **Migration:** `AddProjectPinning` creates `UserPinnedProjects` with composite PK and FKs to Users and Projects (cascade delete).
- **API:**
  - `PUT api/v1/projects/{id}/pin` — body `{ "isPinned": boolean }` — toggles pin for the current user.
  - `GET api/v1/projects/pinned` — returns the current user’s pinned projects.
- **Route order:** `GET projects/pinned` is registered with `Order = 0` so it is matched before `GET projects/{id:guid}` (avoids "pinned" being treated as an id).
- **Resilience:** When the `UserPinnedProjects` table is missing (migration not applied), `GetProjects` and `GetPinnedProjects` return data without pin info; `TogglePin` no-ops so the API returns 200 instead of 500.

### Frontend
- **Types:** `ProjectSummaryDto` includes optional `isPinned` and `pinnedAt`.
- **API:** `getPinnedProjects()` and `toggleProjectPin(id, isPinned)` in `api/projects.ts`.
- **Layout:** AppLayout fetches and exposes `pinnedProjects` and `refreshPinnedProjects`; Sidebar shows a **Pinned Projects** section (above Pinned Boards) with links to `/projects/{id}`.

---

## Project Card Ellipsis Menu

- **ProjectCard** (dashboard and projects page):
  - Three-dot (⋮) menu with **Rename**, **Pin to Sidebar** / **Unpin from Sidebar**, and **Delete** (owner only when `onDelete` is provided).
  - Pin icon on the card when `project.isPinned` is true.
  - Card wrapper changed from `<button>` to `<div role="button">` so menu actions are not nested buttons (fixes DOM nesting warning and ensures Pin/Rename/Delete clicks work).
- **Dashboard:** Project rename dialog, `handleRenameProject` / `confirmRenameProject`, `handleToggleProjectPin`, `handleDeleteProject` / `confirmDeleteProject`; all passed into `ProjectCard`.
- **Projects page:** Same rename, pin, and delete handlers; uses `refreshPinnedProjects` from outlet context after pin/delete.

---

## Boards: Combined Section and “View All Boards”

- **Dashboard:** Note Boards and Chalk Boards are merged into a single **Boards** section. Boards are sorted by last updated; first 6 are shown with a **View All Boards** button linking to `/boards`.
- **New route and page:** `GET /boards` → **BoardsPage** with:
  - Filter pills: **All** | **Note Boards** | **Chalk Boards**.
  - Grid of board cards (same behavior as dashboard: rename, delete, pin, move to project).
  - **New Board** button opening the existing create-board dialog.
- **Router:** Route `/boards` is registered before `/boards/:boardId` so the list page is matched correctly.

---

## Dashboard Sorting

- **Boards:** Sorted by `updatedAt` descending (most recently updated / “opened recently” first).
- **Projects:** Sorted by `createdAt` descending for display (Projects section and MiniCalendar use `activeProjectsSorted`).

---

## Project Name on Board Cards

- When a board is in a project (`board.projectId` set), the **project name** is shown in the top-right of the board card on the dashboard (and on the Boards page), resolved from `activeProjects`.

---

## Board Card Nested Button Fix

- **BoardCard** outer wrapper changed from `<button>` to `<div role="button">` with `tabIndex={0}` and keyboard support so the ellipsis menu items (Rename, Move to Project, Pin, Delete) are not nested inside a button. Fixes the “button cannot appear as a descendant of button” warning and ensures menu actions work.

---

## React Router Future Flags

- **BrowserRouter** now passes `future={{ v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true }}` to opt in to v7 behavior and silence the corresponding console warnings.

---

## Backend / Database and Docs

- **README (backend):**
  - Correct project paths: `src/TableWorks.API/` and `src/TableWorks.Infrastructure/` (not `ASideNote.API` folder names).
  - All EF and run commands shown as single-line so they work in PowerShell.
  - New **“If the database isn’t updating”** section: run from `Source/backend/`, check pending migrations, and ensure connection matches app (e.g. `.env`).
- **AddProjectPinning migration:** Hand-written migration was not discovered by EF. Added `[Migration("20260213120000_AddProjectPinning")]` and `[DbContext(typeof(AppDbContext))]` (and required usings) so `dotnet ef database update` applies it.
- **AppDbContextModelSnapshot:** Updated to include **UserPinnedProjects** entity, its relationships to Project and User, and the `PinnedByUsers` / `PinnedProjects` navigations so future `dotnet ef migrations add` only generates changes for new tables/columns and does not try to recreate `UserPinnedProjects`.

---

## Open Board or Project Immediately After Creation

- **Boards:** After creating a note board or chalk board, the user is navigated directly to the new board (`/boards/:id` or `/chalkboards/:id`). Applied on Dashboard, Boards page, Chalk Boards page, and when creating a board within a project.
- **Projects:** After creating a project, the user is navigated directly to the new project (`/projects/:id`). Applied on Dashboard and Projects page.

---

## Chalk Board: Virtual Canvas Resolution and Zoom

- **Higher virtual canvas resolution:** The Chalk Board canvas is now 2× the display size internally. Strokes drawn at 25% zoom stay crisp when zooming in to 200%, matching the quality of strokes drawn at full zoom.
- **Retina scaling:** Fabric.js `enableRetinaScaling` enabled for sharp rendering on high-DPI displays.
- **Zoom behavior:** Ctrl/Cmd + scroll zooms centered on the cursor (same as Note Boards). Zoom buttons zoom centered on the viewport.
- **Migration:** Existing drawings and notes are scaled on load to the new coordinate system. New saves include a version field for future compatibility.

---

## Branding: New Logo and Favicon

- **Logo:** ASideNote logo added across the app.
  - **Sidebar (dashboard):** Main logo when expanded; square logo when sidebar is collapsed. Logo links to dashboard; fixed-height brand bar with responsive logo sizing.
  - **Landing page:** Centered logo in header and footer; header logo centered with nav on the right.
- **Assets:** `Source/frontend/public/asidenote-logo.png` (main logo), `asidenote-logo-square.png` (square variant for collapsed sidebar).
- **Favicon:** Site favicon updated; referenced in `index.html` as `/favicon.ico` from `Source/frontend/public/`.

---

## Friends List

### Backend
- **FriendRequest** entity: `RequesterId`, `ReceiverId`, `Status` (Pending, Accepted, Rejected), `CreatedAt`, `RespondedAt`. Unique index on `(RequesterId, ReceiverId)`. Migration `AddFriendRequests` creates the table.
- **API (users):**
  - `GET api/v1/users/me/friends` — list of friends (id, username, profilePictureKey, lastLoginAt); sorted by online first (last login within 15 min), then by last login descending.
  - `GET api/v1/users/me/friend-requests` — pending received requests (new at top).
  - `GET api/v1/users/me/friend-requests/status?userId=` — friend status: None, PendingSent, PendingReceived, Friends, Self.
  - `POST api/v1/users/me/friend-requests` — body `{ "receiverId": "guid" }` — send request.
  - `POST api/v1/users/me/friend-requests/{id}/accept` and `.../reject` — respond to request.
  - `GET api/v1/users/search?q=&limit=20` — search users by username or email (excludes self and existing friends/pending); returns public profile list.
  - `GET api/v1/users/{id}` — public profile (id, username, profilePictureKey, bio) for viewing another user.
- **Add member by friend:** `AddMemberRequest` accepts optional `userId` (in addition to email); project owner can add a friend to a project by selecting them from the friends list.

### Frontend
- **Profile page (own):** Quick-stats sticky **Email** replaced with **Friends** count (same sky sticky style). **Friends** section placed below **About**; **Add friend** button above the list opens a dialog. **Friend requests** block (new at top, highlighted) with Accept/Reject per request. **Friends list** shows avatar, username, link to `/profile/:userId`, online indicator (green dot when last login &lt; 15 min), and subtitle: "Online", "Last active X ago", or "Never logged in". List sorted by online then last active (matches backend).
- **Add Friend dialog:** Search by username or email (debounced); results with "Add friend" per user.
- **Other user profile:** Route `/profile/:userId`; shows public profile (avatar, username, bio) and Add Friend area: "Add friend" | "Request sent" | "Friends" | Accept/Reject when they sent you a request.
- **Add Member (project):** Dialog has tabs **By email** and **From friends**; "From friends" lists current user's friends with role picker and Add per friend.
