# TableWorks

TableWorks is a web application designed to help users organize and manage data efficiently using customizable lists and a table-based layout.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of TableWorks is to provide users with a platform where they can:
- **Create accounts** to securely manage their data.
- **Create and manage lists** for various purposes (e.g., tasks, inventories, collections).
- **Organize data in a table layout** for easy viewing, editing, and sorting.

## Key Features
- User authentication and account management
- List creation, editing, and deletion
- Table-based interface for organizing and visualizing list data
- Responsive and intuitive user interface

## Project Layout
