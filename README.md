# TableWorks
- TableWorks is starting as a web application which allows the user to plan projects, create quick notes, and manage their schedule. The app will also include interactive feature to keep the user engaged.
- This app is planned to be lauched as a desktop and IOS app in the future.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of TableWorks is to provide users with a platform where they can:
- **Create accounts** to securely manage their data.
- **Create and manage lists** for various purposes (e.g., tasks, inventories, collections).
- **Organize data in a table layout** for easy viewing, editing, and sorting.
- **Allow users to collaborate with others** for collaboration on projects

## Project Layout
- **Frontend:** (*May Change*) Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite (located in `Source/frontend/`).
- **Backend:** Built using C# ASP.NET (located in `Source/backend/`).
